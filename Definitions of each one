What is Azure Virtual Network?

Answer: Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is the foundation of the Azure networking infrastructure. It allows you to securely connect Azure resources with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. VNets are isolated from each other, enabling you to define network boundaries for different applications.

2. What is a Subnet in Azure?

Answer: A Subnet is a smaller partition or segment of a VNet. It helps in organizing and segmenting the resources within a VNet, which enhances security, isolation, and management of resources based on the workloads and security requirements

3. What is Network Security Group (NSG)?

Answer: A Network Security Group (NSG) controls the inbound and outbound traffic to/from Azure resources (like VMs) at the subnet or NIC level. It contains security rules that define allowed or denied traffic based on source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, and protocol.

4. Application Security Group (ASG) is a feature in Azure that helps us group virtual machines logically based on their role or application tier â€” like web servers, app servers, or database servers.

Instead of writing NSG rules for each VM separately, we can create an ASG, add the related VMs into it, and then write NSG rules for the entire group. This makes managing network security rules much easier and more organized.

4. What is the difference between Horizontal and Vertical Scaling?

Answer:

Vertical Scaling: Increases the CPU or memory of an individual VM.

Horizontal Scaling: Adds or removes instances of VMs based on demand to manage load.


5. What are Availability Sets?

Answer: Availability Sets ensure high availability by distributing VMs across multiple fault and update domains. This helps in protecting workloads from hardware failures or rack-level failures by ensuring that VMs are spread across different physical resources.

6. What are Availability Zones?

Answer: Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region. They provide high availability by distributing resources across multiple datacenters. If one datacenter goes down, the other zones continue running, ensuring minimal downtime.

7. What is VNet Peering?

Answer: VNet Peering allows communication between two VNets, either within the same region (Local VNet Peering) or across different regions (Global VNet Peering). It uses Azureâ€™s backbone network to route traffic securely and with low latency.

8. What is a VPN Gateway in Azure?

Answer: A VPN Gateway establishes a secure connection between Azure and an on-premises network or other Azure VNets. It uses the public internet, providing secure communication over IPsec or IKEv2 protocols.

9. What is ExpressRoute in Azure?

Answer: ExpressRoute provides a private, dedicated connection between an on-premises network and Azure, bypassing the public internet. It offers higher bandwidth, lower latency, and more security than VPN connections.

10. What is a Public IP Address in Azure?

Answer: A Public IP address is used to access Azure resources over the internet. It can be static (fixed) or dynamic (changes when deallocated). Public IPs are assigned to resources like load balancers, VPN gateways, or VMs for internet-facing communication.

11. What is the difference between Static and Dynamic IP?

Answer:

Static IP: Does not change even if the VM is deallocated or restarted.

Dynamic IP: Changes when the VM is deallocated or restarted.


12. What is Network Watcher in Azure?

Answer: Network Watcher is a diagnostic tool that helps monitor and analyze network traffic in Azure. It offers features like IP Flow Verify, Effective Security Rules, and Route Table diagnostics to ensure proper network configuration and troubleshoot issues.

13. What is Route Table in Azure?

Answer: A Route Table defines the routing rules for outbound traffic from subnets in a VNet. It includes user-defined routes (UDRs) that specify the next hop based on destination IPs, such as routing traffic through a VPN gateway or a virtual appliance.

14. What is the difference between System Routes and User-Defined Routes?

Answer:

System Routes: These are the default routes automatically created by Azure, like routing traffic between subnets or to the internet.

User-Defined Routes (UDR): Custom routes created by users to override the default system routes, such as directing traffic through specific appliances or VNets.


15. What is an Azure Firewall?

Answer: Azure Firewall is a fully managed, cloud-native network security service that provides filtering and protection for Azure VNets. It can filter traffic based on application rules, network rules, and NAT rules. It also offers threat intelligence and advanced logging.

16. What is a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA)?

Answer: A Network Virtual Appliance is a VM that acts as a network or security appliance (like a firewall or router). It inspects, controls, and routes traffic between subnets, VNets, or on-premises networks based on configured rules.

17. What is Azure DNS and how is it used in a virtual network setup?

Answer: Azure DNS is a domain name system service that resolves domain names to IP addresses within Azure. In a virtual network setup, Azure DNS helps resolve names for resources, and custom DNS servers can be configured if needed.

18. What is BGP and how does it work in Azure?

Answer: BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) is a routing protocol used to exchange routing information between networks. In Azure, BGP is used with VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute to dynamically exchange routes and manage failover for on-premises and cloud connectivity.

19. What is Azure Bastion?

Answer: Azure Bastion is a fully managed service that provides secure RDP/SSH access to VMs without exposing them to the public internet. It allows access directly through the Azure portal and enhances security by not requiring a publicÂ IPÂ onÂ theÂ VMs.

20.Azure Load Balancer is used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple virtual machines that are placed in a backend pool. This helps to improve availability, scalability, and fault tolerance of applications.
It uses something called health probes to continuously monitor the health of backend VMs. If one VM goes down or becomes unhealthy, the load balancer automatically stops sending traffic to that VM and sends it only to the healthy ones.
Operates at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) â€” TCP and UDP protocols
Supports both Internal and Public Load Balancer
Internal Load Balancer for internal app tiers (e.g., app â†’ DB)
Public Load Balancer for internet-facing apps (e.g., web apps)
21. Application Gateway is a Layer 7 (Application Layer) load balancer in Azure.
It distributes web traffic based on rules like URL paths or domains â€” for example, it can route /images to one backend and /videos to another.
It supports:
URL-based routing (also called path-based routing)
SSL offloading (removes the SSL processing burden from backend VMs)
End-to-end SSL encryption, if needed
Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), etc.
It's ideal for hosting websites, web apps, and APIs with different security and routing needs.
22.NAT Gateway in Azure is used for Network Address Translation (NAT).
It allows virtual machines in a private subnet to access the internet using one or a few public IP addresses, without exposing the VMs directly to the internet.
This way, VMs donâ€™t need individual public IPs, and traffic from them appears to come from the NAT Gatewayâ€™s public IP, improving security and management.

ðŸ”¹ Virtual Network (VNet) is the basic and most important part of Azure networking. It is a private network inside Azure. It helps different Azure resources like Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, Load Balancers, and others to talk to each other, to the internet, and to on-premises networks.

VNet gives security, isolation, and scalability. While creating a VNet, we need to give an address range using CIDR format (like 10.0.0.0/16). This tells Azure how many IPs we want to use inside that network.

ðŸ”¹Inside a VNet, we must create at least one subnet. A subnet is like a small part or section of the VNet. We use subnets to separate resources based on their function â€” like web, app, or database â€” or based on security needs. Subnets help to organize and secure the environment better.

ðŸ”¹We can also attach Network Security Groups (NSGs) and Route Tables to the subnet or even directly to the Virtual Machineâ€™s network card (NIC).

ðŸ”¹NSG is used to allow or block network traffic. It works using rules that check source IP, destination IP, port numbers, and protocols (like TCP/UDP). Each rule has a priority number, and the rule with the lowest number gets applied first. For example, I allow port 80 or 443 for web access or block all outbound internet traffic from a subnet.

ðŸ”¹Route Tables are used to control where traffic should go. We create custom routes to send traffic to firewalls like FortiGate or Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs) before it reaches its destination. This is useful for monitoring or filtering the traffic.

ðŸ”¹Azure Bastion helps to securely connect to VMs using RDP or SSH through the Azure Portal, without giving them a public IP. It uses port 443 (TLS/SSL), so itâ€™s secure and avoids direct exposure to the internet.

ðŸ”¹Load Balancer
Azure Load Balancer works at Layer 4, which is the transport layer. It helps to distribute TCP or UDP traffic across backend virtual machines or services to improve availability and performance.

There are two types:

Internal Load Balancer, which is used for private traffic inside a VNet.

Public (Internet-facing) Load Balancer, which is used when we want to allow traffic from the internet to Azure resources, like a web server.

It checks health probes to see which backend VM is healthy before sending traffic.

ðŸ”¹ Application Gateway
Azure Application Gateway works at Layer 7, which is the application layer.

It supports URL-based routing â€” for example, traffic to /images can go to one server and /videos to another.

It also supports SSL termination, which means it handles encryption/decryption at the gateway level, and it has a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against attacks like SQL injection or cross-site scripting.

ðŸ”¹ Azure Firewall
Azure Firewall is a stateful firewall that we can use to control inbound and outbound traffic from a central place.

It is highly available, can scale automatically, and supports threat intelligence to block known bad IPs or domains.

Itâ€™s commonly used in hub-and-spoke architectures, where all traffic flows through a central hub with the firewall for inspection.

ðŸ”¹ VPN Gateway
Azure VPN Gateway is used to connect Azure to on-premises networks using Site-to-Site VPN, Point-to-Site VPN, or VNet-to-VNet connections.

It uses IPsec/IKE protocols to provide secure and encrypted communication.

This is helpful when we need a hybrid setup between cloud and on-prem infrastructure.

ðŸ”¹ ExpressRoute
ExpressRoute gives a private, dedicated connection between on-premises networks and Azure â€” it doesnâ€™t go through the public internet.

It provides higher security, better reliability, more bandwidth, and lower latency.

It's mostly used by large organizations for critical workloads and secure hybrid environments.

ðŸ”¹ Private Endpoint / Private Link
A Private Endpoint assigns a private IP from your VNet to a PaaS service like Azure Storage or SQL.

This means the resource can be accessed privately within your network, and the traffic stays on the Microsoft backbone, not the public internet.

It improves security by keeping the service hidden from the outside world.
